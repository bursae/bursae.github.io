### Water

Water shapes both the map and the daily function of the county. The Hackensack and Passaic systems run through Bergen, while Oradell Reservoir, Woodcliff Lake and Lake Tappan support regional supply.

### Mountains & Cliffs

The terrain changes quickly at the edges. The Ramapo Mountains rise in the northwest, and the Palisades form a steep basalt wall over the Hudson. Bergen can feel geographically varied.

### Transportation

Transportation drives the county. I-80, I-95, Route 4 and Route 17 move workers and goods every day, backed by NJ Transit service into Hoboken and New York City. Bridges and tunnels connect Bergen directly to Manhattan.

### Towns

In Bergen County, with Hackensack as its seat, power is local. Seventy municipalities - Ridgewood and Fort Lee among them - control their schools, zoning and tax base. The fragmentation dates to “boroughitis,” the 1890s incorporation rush after school and tax laws made secession fiscally rational. Bergen sits in New York’s orbit but governs as a federation of guarded municipalities.
