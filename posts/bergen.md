# The County of Bergen

---

### Boundaries
![Map showing boundaries](../images/bound.png)

Bergen County sits in the northeast corner of New Jersey. New York borders it to the north and east, with the Hudson defining its eastern edge. Passaic and Essex border the west and south, but in practice the county is tied most closely to the New York commuter economy.

### Water

Water shapes both the map and the daily function of the county. The Hackensack and Passaic systems run through Bergen, while Oradell Reservoir, Woodcliff Lake and Lake Tappan support regional supply. Much of the landscape is also infrastructure.

### Mountains & Cliffs

The terrain changes quickly at the edges. The Ramapo Mountains rise in the northwest, and the Palisades form a steep basalt wall over the Hudson. Bergen can feel geographically varied, but economically it operates as part of one metropolitan system.

### Transportation

Transportation drives the county. I-80, I-95, Route 4 and Route 17 move workers and goods every day, backed by NJ Transit service into Hoboken and New York City. Bridges and tunnels connect Bergen directly to Manhattan and the Bronx.

### Towns

Hackensack is the county seat, but Bergen is defined by its network of municipalities. Englewood, Ridgewood, Teaneck and Fort Lee each have distinct local identities. Together they function as part of a regionally connected county tied to New York.
