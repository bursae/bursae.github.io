- Olive oil  
- Sea salt  
- 1 lemon

## Method

- Place each lobster on its back, then swiftly drive the tip of a sharp knife between the eyes and split clean through - cleanly and humanely.
- Split in half lengthwise and brush the meat with olive oil.
- Grill **shell-side down** over a medium-hot fire until the shells turn deep red and white foam seeps from the tail - 8–10 minutes for smaller lobsters, 12–14 for larger.
- Finish with sea salt and a hard squeeze of lemon.
