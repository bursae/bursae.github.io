# Grilled Lobster

![Grilled Lobster](../images/lobster.png)

There’s nothing delicate about a lobster. It's armored, cracks clams for a living, and survives under crushing tides. The only way to eat one is over fire - not drowned in butter.

## Ingredients

- 2 live lobsters (1½–2 lb hard-shells)  
- Olive oil  
- Sea salt  
- 1 lemon

## Method

1. Place each lobster on its back. Drive a sharp knife between the eyes and split clean through. No slow boiling, end it quickly.

2. Brush the exposed meat with olive oil. Not for flavor just so it doesn’t weld itself to the grill.

3. Lay on a medium-hot fire **cut-side down** for 2–3 minutes. Flip to **shell-side down** and cook until the shell turns deep red and white foam seeps from the tail - 8–10 minutes for smaller lobsters, 12–14 for larger.

4. Remove, sprinkle with sea salt, and give each half a hard squeeze of lemon.
