# Grilled Lobster

## Ingredients

- 2 live lobsters (1½–2 lb hard-shells)  
- Olive oil  
- Sea salt  
- 1 lemon  

---

## Method

- Place each lobster on its back. With a sharp knife, swiftly pierce between the eyes and split lengthwise in one clean motion. 
- Brush the exposed meat lightly with olive oil.
- Grill cut-side down over medium-hot until the shells are deep red and white foam seeps from the tail - about 8–10 minutes for small lobsters, 12–14 minutes for larger ones. 
- Remove from the grill, sprinkle generously with flaky sea salt, and finish with a hard squeeze of fresh lemon.
