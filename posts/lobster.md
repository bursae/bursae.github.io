- Olive oil  
- Sea salt  
- 1 lemon

## Method

- Place each lobster on its back. Swiftly drive the tip of a sharp knife between the eyes and split clean through - humane and decisive.  
- Split in half lengthwise and brush the meat with olive oil.  
- Grill **cut side down** over a medium-hot fire until the shells turn deep red and white foam seeps from the tail - ~8–10 min for smaller lobsters, 12–14 min for larger.  
- Finish with sea salt and a hard squeeze of lemon.
