## Timeline

| **Year / Era** | **Event** |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Pre-1700s** | Region inhabited and traversed by Lenape people, who hunted and fished throughout the Hackensack Meadowlands.<sup>[1]</sup> |
| **1700s–1800s** | Area forms part of the Kingsland family holdings in *New Barbadoes Neck*, a large tract spanning the Meadowlands corridor.<sup>[2]</sup> |
| **1872 (approx.)** | The **Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad** establishes a repair shop and depot — the settlement becomes known as *Kingsland.*<sup>[3][4]</sup> |
| **Late 1800s–Early 1900s** | A working railroad hamlet emerges — clustered worker housing, shops, and industry tied to DL&W operations.<sup>[3][4][5]</sup> |
| **1916–1917** | **Canadian Car & Foundry** operates a major munitions plant here. **Jan 11, 1917 — Kingsland Explosion** destroys the facility; no recorded fatalities.<sup>[6]</sup> |
| **1920s–1940s** | Post-WWI redevelopment shifts toward **light manufacturing, warehousing, and expanding residential streets.**<sup>[5][7]</sup> |
| **1950s–Present** | Rail declines, suburbs rise — Kingsland becomes a **commuter neighborhood** built on filled marsh and former industrial ground.<sup>[5][7]</sup> |
| **Today** | Low houses, light industry, and old rail lines remain — a town shaped by land reclamation, labor, and one unforgettable fire.<sup>[5][7]</sup> |
