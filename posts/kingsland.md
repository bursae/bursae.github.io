Lyndhurst, New Jersey, sits in the Hackensack Meadowlands between the Passaic and Hackensack rivers, a low-lying stretch once defined by tidal marsh and freight yards. Incorporated in 1917, it developed as part of the industrial and commuter network linking northern New Jersey to Manhattan. Today it is a stable, middle-class borough of modest homes and reliable rail service, exporting labour east each morning and drawing its fortunes from the wider New York economy.
