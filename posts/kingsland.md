| **Aspect**            | **Details**                                                                                                                   |

| **Location**          | Western edge of the Hackensack Meadowlands, Bergen County NJ — ~8 mi from NYC; wedged between salt-meadow and upland ridge.   |
| **Soil / Terrain**    | Meadow muck over marl (once dug for brick-earth), turning to loam and gravel inland. Formerly oak- and hickory-timbered.       |
| **Air / Climate**     | Damp airs, fog drifting in off the Meadowlands.                                                                                |
| **Historical Uses**   | Lenape hunting grounds → Dutch pasture → brickmaking & DL&W rail-shops → WWI munitions → toys/barbells → warehousing/freight. |
| **Today**             | Plain, workmanlike commuter quarter of brick/clapboard houses clustered around Kingsland station.                              |
| **Character**         | Long Italian-American railroad village; now a mortgage-holding, quietly aspirational commuter backwater.                       |
