| **Aspect**               | **Details**                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Location**             | Western edge of the Hackensack Meadowlands in southern Bergen County, NJ — ~8 mi from NYC, wedged between salt-meadow and upland ridge.                               |
| **Soil & Situation**     | Meadow-muck and clay over marl (once worked for brick-earth), firming to loam/gravel inland. Formerly oak- and hickory-timbered; damp airs and fogs drifting in.     |
| **Industry History**     | Lenape hunting grounds → Dutch clay pits/pasture → brickworks & DL&W rail-shops → WWI munitions (Canadian Car & Foundry, 1917) → toys, barbells → warehousing/freight.|
| **Present Condition**    | Commuter quarter of modest brick/clapboard houses centred on Kingsland NJ Transit station. Industry has ebbed; place retains a plain, workmanlike aspect.            |
| **Population & Character** | Long a no-nonsense Italian-American railroad village; now a mortgage-holding, quietly aspirational commuter backwater.                                           |
